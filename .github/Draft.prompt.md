Whenever the play card becomes available always move the keyboard focus to the button so that a user can just hit enter to play the card. 

Note: Implemented focus transfer to the Play Card button whenever it becomes enabled by tracking the enabled state and focusing via JS interop (`focusElement`) in `CardGame/Pages/Game.razor`.
