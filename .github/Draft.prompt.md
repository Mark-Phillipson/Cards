Can we add a TextBox to the form to store the number of milliseconds for a delay before auto-submission? The user should be able to input a value in milliseconds, and this value will determine how long the system waits before automatically submitting the form after the user stops typing.

The minimum should be between 50 and 10000 milliseconds and the default shall be 500 milliseconds. If the user inputs a value outside this range, display an error message prompting them to enter a valid number within the specified range.
