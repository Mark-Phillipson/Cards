I've done a publish for the application can I run it locally to test the publish is working correctly?

Yes, you can run the published application locally to test it. Here's how you can do it:

1. Navigate to the publish output folder (e.g., `CardGame/publish/wwwroot`).
2. Use a simple HTTP server to serve the files. If you have Python installed, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   cd CardGame/publish/wwwroot
   python -m http.server 8080
   ```

3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to see the published application running locally.

This will allow you to verify that the publish process worked correctly and that the application behaves as expected when served from the published output.

 Can you provide me with a PowerShell version of the command?
Certainly! If you want to serve the published application using PowerShell, you can use the `Start-Process` cmdlet to launch a simple HTTP server. Here's how you can do it:
1. Open PowerShell and navigate to the publish output folder:

   ```powershell
   Set-Location -Path "CardGame\publish\wwwroot"
   ```

2. Start a simple HTTP server using PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "-NoExit", "-Command", "python -m http.server 8080"
   ```

3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to see the published application running locally.

This will allow you to verify that the publish process worked correctly and that the application behaves as expected when served from the published output.

I just did the powershell commands but it did not seem to work when I to up the commands nothing is returned in the the terminal is this correct?
